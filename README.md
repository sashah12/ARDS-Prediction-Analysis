# ARDS-Prediction-Analysis
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening lung injury that allows fluid to leak into the lungs. Breathing becomes difficult and oxygen cannot get into the body. It is often difficult to detect and thus, data science and machine learning becomes a critical tool which can be used to help try and identify causes, patterns, and onsets of ARDS. As part of the Dascena Data Science challenge, I was given this dataset in order to try and utilize data science and machine learning to try and predict the onsets of ARDS. Through this project, I strengthened my EDA, modeling, predictive analysis, and machine learning skills.
